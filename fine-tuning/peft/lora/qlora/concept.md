# QLoRA

Quantization LoRA

## Definition

- High-precision computing methods + low-precision storage methods
- Only parameters in the model is quantized

## Features

- Comparable inference accuracy to LoRA
- Require much fewer bits than LoRA

## Techniques

- 4-bit Normal Float
- Double Quantization
- Error Reduction with LoRA Tuning
